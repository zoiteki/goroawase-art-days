# Goroawase Art Days

This repo contains a list of days commonly used by primarily Japanese artists. These are primarily done using Goroawase, or a type of pun using numeric substitution / phonetic matching. A very short explanation is that numbers can be read in multiple different ways, leading to different ways to write a number in japanese using the western alphabet which can be used to create various wordplay. For more information see [Numeric Substitution in Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_substitution_in_Japanese), [Legends of Localization](https://legendsoflocalization.com/articles/goroawase-japanese-number-wordplay/). November is a particularly popular month because 11 => ii => いい which can be translated as "nice", so November is filled with `Nice ___ days`

This is just an excuse for artists or people who have commissioned art to share their art related to the day in question, using the hashtag for engagement.

I'm just keeping track of the ones I see and sharing it so people can have art to share and know about it ahead of time.

Let me know if I'm missing any days.
